### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Free MQL4 tools giveaway:

 I. iWhisper [indicator] 
   - on tick calculation, show as comment
   - allocated real face risk(risk size, not margin)(including pending orders), idle balance, idle lot(100% margin level), min/max pip value of symbol in account currency
   - paired with *VolatilityBook to provide SL movement for a timeframe then, max burst times for min lot step, 5-9-11-13-23 burst lot size calculation (balance)
   - when an order doesn't have SL, fallback to VolatilityBook default SL to assume real face risk.

 II. [class] written low level MQL4 utils, all unmutable unless specified:
   - MathUtil (floor_mod for circular array indexing)
   - PrimitiveArrayList
   - PrimitiveStream
   - TArrayList (returned reference via get, mutable)
   - TStream (timeseries alike, constant O(1) read/write with fixed size)
   - TChannel (deque alike, but not really)

Contact author if interested in tools/topic. For tools, will give and briefly discuss usage n limitations, non-commercial uses only. For topic, any attempt to build a mutual benefit is welcomed. Response is not guaranteed.
